# Minecraft-Server-Generator

Automatically builds a MC server for you and allows you to choose the type. (Linux only for now)

Building includes downloading the jar, running the initial setup, accepting EULA, and generating a start.sh script. 

Does NOT download required java versions or install plugins (yet...)

# Supported Server Types
